File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️

This program reads the content of a file, modifies it (in this example, converts text to uppercase), and writes the modified content to a new file.

Example:

If input.txt contains:

Hello, Python!


After running the program, output.txt will contain:

HELLO, PYTHON!

Error Handling Lab 🧪

The program also includes an error-handling function where the user is asked to input a filename. If the file:

❌ does not exist → it shows a File Not Found error.

🚫 cannot be read due to permissions → it shows a Permission Denied message.

⚠️ encounters any other issue → it prints the error message.

How to Use

Create a text file named input.txt with some text in it.

Run the program.

It will create a new file named output.txt containing the modified content.

You can also test error handling by entering different filenames when prompted.
